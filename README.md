## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to my submission for the Lendsqr Frontend Assessment project. This project is my attempt to showcase my skills as a frontend engineer by building a web application based on the design provided in Figma.

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- SCSS for styling
- Mock API using mocky.io

## Challenges Faced

Throughout the development of this project, I encountered several challenges that tested my problem-solving skills and attention to detail:

1. **Implementing Pagination**: Initially, implementing pagination for the table data fetched from the mock API posed a challenge. It required careful state management to track the current page and items per page, ensuring smooth navigation through the data.

2. **Responsive Design**: Achieving a responsive design that looks good across different devices was a significant challenge. I had to carefully adjust the layout and styling using media queries in SCSS to ensure optimal viewing on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.

3. **Loading State**: Providing feedback to users while fetching data asynchronously was crucial. Managing the loading state and displaying a loading indicator required thoughtful handling using React's useState and useEffect hooks.

4. **Visual Fidelity**: Ensuring that the application matches the design provided in Figma pixel by pixel was a meticulous task. I paid close attention to detail and meticulously adjusted the styling to achieve the desired visual fidelity.

## Approach Taken

To overcome these challenges and build a high-quality application, I adopted the following approach:

1. **Component-Based Development**: I structured the application using a component-based approach, breaking down the UI into reusable components such as Login, Dashboard, Sidebar, and Pagination. This facilitated code organization and maintainability.

2. **State Management**: I used React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management. State variables were utilized to track user input, loading states, and pagination data, ensuring a smooth user experience.

3. **Styling with SCSS**: SCSS was employed for styling to leverage its features such as variables, mixins, and nesting. This resulted in cleaner and more maintainable CSS code, enhancing the development process.

4. **Mock API Integration**: I utilized the mock API provided by mocky.io to simulate data fetching for the application. This enabled realistic testing of data fetching and pagination functionality, ensuring the application behaves as expected.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project has been an exciting opportunity for me to demonstrate my frontend engineering skills. By leveraging React with TypeScript and SCSS, and adhering to best practices in frontend development, I have successfully built an application that meets the visual fidelity requirements and implements the required functionality.

Thank you for considering my submission. I look forward to discussing my approach and insights further in the technical interview.
